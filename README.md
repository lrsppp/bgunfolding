## Abstract

Especially in astroparticle physics, quantities of interest like the energy spectra of cosmic gamma-ray sources are not directly observable due to the measurement process. The reconstruction of the relevant quantity is called unfolding. In the case of IACT data (Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope), Cherenkov light which is produced by high-energy gamma particles is observed along with a background from charged cosmic rays, which cannot be fully removed. The methodical investigation of the unfolding of these energy spectra is part of this work. Different unfolding methods are evaluated and compared on the basis of Monte-Carlo simulations. In particular, the influence of irreducible background on the unfolded spectra and on the unfolding procedures is investigated. In addition, methods for the estimation of uncertainties are presented.
Using different algorithms to unfold FACT data including background.
